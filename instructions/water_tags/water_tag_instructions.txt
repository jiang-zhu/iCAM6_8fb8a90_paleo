Steps for setting up a water tracer simulation in iCAM6:

NOTE:  This is developmental code, so these instructions may
       change in the future.

1.  Create new case (i.e. run iCESM1.2/scripts/create_newcase).

2.  Run case.setup

3.  Add "-water_tracer h2o_h216o_hdo_h218o" to CAM_CONFIG_OPTS in env_build.xml.
    Please note that this is needed even if you aren't simulating water isotopes.

4.  Add the line "-water_tag_num N" to the CAM_CONFIG_OPTS in env_build.xml,
    where "N" is the number of water tracers you are using.  So, if using the
    provided example tracers, then you will want to set N to two, or "-water_tag_num 2".
    You will then need to increase this number by one for every additional water tracer
    or tag you add to the simulation.

5.  Copy the example "atm_import_export.F90" file into your SourceMods/src.cam directory.
    This file is where the actual water tracer boundaries are specified, and will
    thus need to be modified for any additional water tracers.  These additions are
    located in the "atm_import" subroutine, in the "wtrc_nsrfvap" do-loop.

6.  Copy the example "atm_comp_mct.F90" file into your SourceMods/src.cam directory.
    This file will not need to be modified further.

7.  Copy the example "user_nl_cam" file into your case directory (or add the contents to your
    user_nl_cam file if you have already modified it).  For every new water tracer that is added,
    you will need to add the tracer names similar to the example "LND" and "NPAC" tracers already provided
    to the relevant namelist variables.  You will also need to add an additional 7 "H2O" quantities to the
    "wtrc_species_names" variable, and an additional series of "VAPOR, LIQUID, ICE, etc." to the "wtrc_type_names" variable.

8.  Build the model (run case.build script in case directory).

9.  Run the model  (run case.submit script in case directory).

10. Once the model is finished running, you should find variables with the same names you provided in user_nl_cam
    in the history files that contain the associated water mass quantities for your water tracer.  Please note that
    tracers are initialized to match standard model water, so it usually takes ~3 months before the tracers become
    noticeabily different from regular model water.  If you are having trouble seeing the spatial patterns in the
    tracers, then I would recommend calculating the tracer ratio (R_tag = TAG/H2O) and plotting that instead.

Good luck!
